## Connecting a Database in a MERN Stack Application

This guide walks you through setting up MongoDB for a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project, configuring access, and integrating it with your backend code.

---

### 1. Set Up MongoDB Atlas

1. Visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/).
2. Sign in or create an account.
3. **Create a New Project:**
    - Enter a project name.
    - Assign an owner.
    - Click **Create Project**.
4. **Create a Cluster:**
    - Choose your preferred cloud provider (e.g., AWS).
    - Select a region.
    - Configure cluster settings as needed.

---

### 2. Configure Database Access

- **Database Users:**
  - Go to **Database Access**.
  - Click **Add New Database User**.
  - Set a username and password.
  - Assign appropriate roles (e.g., `readWriteAnyDatabase` for development).
- **Network Access:**
  - Go to **Network Access**.
  - Click **Add IP Address**.
  - For development, you can allow access from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).  
     **Note:** Restrict IPs in production for security.

---

### 3. Obtain Connection String

- In your cluster dashboard, click **Connect**.
- Choose **Connect your application**.
- Copy the provided connection string.

---

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
PORT=your_port_number
MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string_without_trailing_slash
```

Replace `your_connection_string_without_trailing_slash` with the string you copied, updating the username and password as needed.

---

### 5. Define Database Name Constant

In `/src/constants.js`:

```js
export const DB_NAME = "your_database_name";
```

---

### 6. Organize Database Connection Code

You can connect to MongoDB in two ways:

1. **Directly in the Entry File:**  
    Place the connection logic in your main file (e.g., `index.js`).

2. **Modular Approach (Recommended):**  
    - Create a `db` folder.
    - Write the connection logic in a separate file (e.g., `db/connection.js`).
    - Import and execute this function in your entry file for cleaner, modular code.

---

### 7. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install mongoose express dotenv
```

---

### 8. Use Express and Mongoose

- Use **Express** to build your server.
- Use **Mongoose** to interact with MongoDB.

---

**Tip:** Always keep your credentials secure and never commit your `.env` file to version control.


---

### 9. Handling Database Connections Safely

When working with databases, always wrap your code in `try...catch` blocks and use `async/await` to handle asynchronous operations reliably.

#### **Approach 1: Direct Connection in Entry File**

You can connect to MongoDB directly in your main file (e.g., `index.js`). Here's an example using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) for better structure:

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { DB_NAME } from "./constants";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

;(async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`);
        app.on("error", (error) => {
            console.error("ERROR: ", error);
            throw error;
        });

        app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
            console.log(`App is listening on ${process.env.PORT}`);
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("ERROR: ", error);
        throw error;
    }
})(); // Semicolon at the start is a best practice to avoid ASI issues
```

#### **Approach 2: Modular Connection Function**

For better organization, create a separate connection module (e.g., `db/connection.js`):

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { DB_NAME } from "../constants";

const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`);
        console.log(`\nMongoDB connected! DataBase HOST: ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("MONGODB Connection Error: ", error);
        process.exit(1);
    }
};

export default connectDB;
```

Then, import and call `connectDB()` in your entry file before starting your server.

In your entry file (e.g., `index.js` or `app.js`), load environment variables and initialize the database connection as follows:

```js
// Optionally, you can use require syntax:
// require('dotenv').config({ path: './env' })

import dotenv from "dotenv";
import connectDB from "./db/index.js";

dotenv.config({
    path: './env'
});

connectDB();
```

This ensures your environment variables are loaded before attempting to connect to the database. Make sure the path to your `.env` file is correct.

**Best Practice:**  
Always handle errors gracefully and ensure your server only starts after a successful database connection.
