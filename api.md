You can configure `cors` and `cookie-parser` middleware in your Express app before defining your routes. This ensures that all incoming requests are processed by these middlewares.

Example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();

// Configure CORS
app.use(cors());

// Configure cookie-parser
app.use(cookieParser());

// Define your routes below
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});
```

To handle data from various sources such as URL parameters, JSON payloads, request bodies, direct forms, or JSON forms, you need to configure body parsing middleware in Express. Use `express.json()` for JSON data and `express.urlencoded()` for form data.

Example:

```js
// Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Parse URL-encoded bodies (form submissions)
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

This setup allows your routes to access data from `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params` depending on how the data is sent.


> **Note:** In earlier versions of Express, handling JSON and URL-encoded data required the `body-parser` package. As of Express 4.16.0 and later, `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` are built-in middleware, so you no longer need to install or use `body-parser` separately for these tasks.

To handle file uploads in your Express app, use the `multer` middleware. Multer processes `multipart/form-data` requests, which are commonly used for uploading files.

Example:

```js
const multer = require('multer');

// Configure storage options
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, 'uploads/'); // Specify upload directory
    },
    filename: function (req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname); // Unique filename
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

// Route for handling file upload
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
});
```

> **Note:** Make sure the `uploads/` directory exists in your project root, or create it before uploading files.

These are common parameter names for middleware functions in Express.js, a popular Node.js web framework.

- **err**: The error object. If present, it indicates an error occurred earlier in the middleware chain.
- **req**: The request object. Contains information about the HTTP request (headers, body, params, etc.).
- **res**: The response object. Used to send a response back to the client.
- **next**: A function that passes control to the next middleware in the chain.

**Example error-handling middleware:**

````javascript
// Express error-handling middleware
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
}
````

**Gotcha:**  
Error-handling middleware in Express must have four parameters (err, req, res, next) to be recognized as such. Regular middleware only uses (req, res, next).
